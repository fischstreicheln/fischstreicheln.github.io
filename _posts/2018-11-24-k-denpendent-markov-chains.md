Markov property states that the future evolution of the stochastic process depends only on its
current state, not depending on the passed transitions of the process. Otherwise, it is not Markovian.

However, in some cases, there is a way to transform a non-Markovian chain into a Markov chain, of
course, **with some cost**.

## k-denpendent Markov Chain
When the future evolution of a chain depends on more than its current state, but also $$k-1$$ step(s)
forward, this chain can be made into a Markov chain, at the cost of *increasing the number of states*.

This is a state diagram of a simple city weather model, categorizing the city weather into **sunny**
and **not-sunny** states, supposing the weather of the next day depends only on the weather of the
observing day. Obviously, the model is a Markov Chain.

Now consider a complicated model. The city weather is categorized into **sunny** and **not-sunny**
states, and the weather of the next day depends on the weather of both the observing day *and the
day before the observing day*. Clearly, itâ€™s a non-Markovian situation.

However, it is possible the converting this chain into a Markov chain by *increasing the number of
states*:
* In the original model, observation at time step $$n+1$$ depends on the state at both time step
$$n$$ and $$n-1$$.
* Now consider *the combination of the observation at time step $$n+1$$ and the state at time step
$$n$$ as the **new defined observation at time step $$n+1$$***, that depends *ONLY* on *a **new defined
state at time step $$n$$** which is the combination of states at time step $$n$$ and $$n-1$$*. Other
settings of the original model remain the same.
* In this modified model, the observation at time step $$n+1$$, i.e. the consecutive weather status
of the day $$n$$ and $$n+1$$, depends *ONLY* on the state at time step $$n$$, i.e. the consecutive
weather status of day $$n-1$$ and $$n$$.

By applying this technique, the new model is a Markov chain with the number of states increased:
* In the original model, the city weather is categorized into **sunny** and **not-sunny** states.
* In the modified model, the city weather *of two consecutive days* is categorized into **sunny/sunny**,
**sunny/not-sunny**, **not-sunny/sunny** and **not-sunny/not-sunny** states, the number of which is
doubled.

Here is a sample state diagram of the modified model.
