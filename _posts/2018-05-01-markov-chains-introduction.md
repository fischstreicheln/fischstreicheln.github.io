# Stochastic Process
* **Stochastic Process** can be defined as a family of random variables $$\{X(t), t\in T\}$$, 
each $$ r.v. X(t)$$ is defined on some **probability space**.
* $$X(t)$$ denotes
* , the values of $$ X(t) $$ are
called **states**. The set of all possible states forms the **state space** of the stochastic
process.

[[Jekyll Steup Notes]]
classification of stochastic processes can be demonstrated as followed:

    B-->D;
    C-->D;

# Markov Property

**Markov** property, i.e. **Memoryless** property, states that the future evolution of
the process depends **only** on its **current** state.
