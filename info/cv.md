Hi! This is Jason! A few years ago, I studied Geophysics in University of Science and Technology of China, graduated and received my Bachelor degree of Science. After that, I continued my self-study in foreign languages and statistics using online resources such as Coursera and Duolingo etc. Recently, I passed the examination modules of the Graduate Diploma in Statistics of Hong Kong Statistical Society: "Probability Distributions", "Statistical Inference", "Stochastic Processes and Time Series" and "Topics in Applied Statistics".

I see myself as a language learning enthusiast because I want to know the world better. Currently, I can speak Chinese(Mandarin and Cantonese), English and German. I have learned German for several years using "Duolingo", and have been attending systematic courses at language school for a year and a half. I am now pursuing German language skills at B2 level. After reaching a solid B2 level, I might start to take on the challenge of learning Japanese.
