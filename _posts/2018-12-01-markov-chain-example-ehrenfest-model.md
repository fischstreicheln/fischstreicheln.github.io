## Markov Chain
* **Markov Process** is a type of stochastic process with **Markov Property**.
* **Markov Chain** is a type of Markov process with discrete state space.

### Markov Property
**Markov Property**, i.e. **Memoryless** property, states that the future evolution of the process
depends *ONLY* on its *current* state, not depending on the passed transitions of the process.

### Discrete Time Markov Chain
* **Discrete Time Markov Chain(DTMC)** is a type of Markov Chain with discrete parameter space.

When we study the behavior of a DTMC, we observe its state at a discrete set of times. In practical
applications, when transitions from state to state can only take place, or fail to take place at
some time instants which are short enough to be omitted comparing to the time durations that the
process stays in states, we could approximately observe the process at a discrete set of time.
* When these time instants are mostly taken to be one unit apart, we could represent the discrete
parameter space, or say index set $$T$$ by the set of natural numbers $$\{0,1,2,\ldots \}$$.
* The successive observations define the set of $$r.v. X(t)$$ which could also be represented with a
set of $$\{X_0,X_1,X_2,\ldots ,X_n,\ldots \}$$ at time instants $$0,1,2,\ldots ,n,\ldots$$
respectively.

Mathematically, **DTMC $$\{X_n, n=1,2,\ldots\}$$** is a stochastic process that satisfies the **Markov
property**, i.e. $$\forall n$$ and $$\forall$$ state $$x_n$$,

$$
\mathbf{Pr}(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}\mid X_n=x_n, X_{n-1}=x_{n-1},\ldots ,X_0=x_0) \\
=\mathbf{Pr}(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}\mid X_n=x_n)
$$

## Notation
### States
For simplicity, we could use single letters, such as $$i, j, k, \ldots$$, to represent the states
instead of $$x_i, x_j, x_k, \ldots$$.

### (Single-step) Transition Probability
The **single-step transition probability**, or just the **transition probability**, of the Markov
Chain is given by the conditional probability of making transition from state $$x_n=i$$ to state
$$x_{n+1}=j$$ when the time parameter increases from $$n$$ to $$n+1$$, denoted as
$$p_{ij}(n)=\mathbf{Pr}(X_{n+1}=j\mid X_n=i)$$.

### Transition Probability Matrix
The **transition probability matrix**, or **chain matrix** $$P(n)$$ is the matrix formed with the
transition probabilities $$p_{ij}(n)=\mathbf{Pr}(X_{n+1}=j\mid X_n=i)$$ as the elements of row $$i$$
and column $$j$$ for all $$i$$ and $$j$$,

$$
P(n)=\left( \begin{array}{cccccc} p_{00}(n) & p_{01}(n) & p_{02}(n) & \cdots & p_{0j}(n) & \cdots \\
p_{10}(n) & p_{11}(n) & p_{12}(n) & \cdots & p_{1j}(n) & \cdots \\
p_{20}(n) & p_{21}(n) & p_{22}(n) & \cdots & p_{2j}(n) & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \cdots \\
p_{i0}(n) & p_{i1}(n) & p_{i2}(n) & \cdots & p_{ij}(n) & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \end{array} \right)
\begin{array}{c} \dashrightarrow \sum{p_{0j}(n)} = 1 \\
\dashrightarrow \sum{p_{1j}(n)} = 1 \\
\dashrightarrow \sum{p_{2j}(n)} = 1 \\
\vdots \\
\dashrightarrow \sum{p_{ij}(n)} = 1 \\
\vdots \end{array}
$$

elements of which satisfy $$\forall i,j$$ $$0\leq p_{ij}(n)\leq 1$$ and $$\sum_{all j}{p_{ij}(n)}=1$$.

### State Diagram
The behavior of the Markov chain is usually illustrated with **state diagram**, where
* Circles are used to represent states, and
* Directed arrows with values are used to represent single-step transition from states to states, whose
* Values are used to represent single-step transition probabilities respectively.

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR;
    A((3))--1-->B((2));
    B--2/3-->C((1));
    C--1/3-->D((0));
    D--1-->C;
    C--2/3-->B;
    B--1/3-->A;
</div>

This is a state diagram of **Ehrenfest Model** with $$N=3$$, which is a simple model of the exchange
of heat or gas molecules between two isolated bodies, by formulated as simple ball and urn models.
* The balls correspond to the molecules, and there are $$N=3$$ balls in the system in this case.
* The urns correspond to the two isolated bodies, and the urns are labeled with 1 and 2.
* At each time instant, a ball in the system is chosen at random and moved from the current urn to
the other one.
* Let $$r.v. X_n$$ be the number of balls in the urn \#1 after $$n^{th}$$ selection, or $$n$$ time
steps.

Since the number of balls in urn \#1 at time step $$n+1$$ depends only on the number of balls in
urn \#1 at time step $$n$$, the stochastic process $$\{X_n, n=1,2,\ldots\}$$ is a Markov chain.
