Hi! This is Jason! I see myself as a language learning enthusiast because I want to know the world better. Currently, I can speak Chinese(Mandarin and Cantonese), English and German. I have learned German for several years using "Duolingo", an iOS language learning app, and have been attending systematic courses at language school for a year and a half. I am now pursuing German language skills at B2 level. After reaching a solid B2 level, I might start to take on the challenge of learning Japanese.
